# Testable-PGx-Genes-Database

This repository contains Python script and data for building a Testable Pharmacogenomic (PGx) Genes Database, which includes gene-to-genotype mappings, therapeutic areas, and associated drugs. The goal of this project is to create a structured database that supports personalized medicine by allowing clinicians and researchers to identify relevant drugs and dosing recommendations based on gene and genotypes.
