# Testable-PGx-Genes-Database

This repository contains Python script and data for building a Testable Pharmacogenomic (PGx) Genes Database, which includes gene-to-genotype mappings, therapeutic areas, and associated drugs. The goal of this project is to create a structured database that supports personalized medicine by allowing clinicians and researchers to identify relevant drugs and dosing recommendations based on gene and genotypes.

## Project Overview

The Testable PGx Genes Database focuses on extracting and structuring data from pharmacogenomic sources, primarily PharmGKB, to provide information about genes, genotypes, therapeutic areas, and associated drugs. This database is designed to support applications that require pharmacogenomic testing and personalized medication recommendations.
